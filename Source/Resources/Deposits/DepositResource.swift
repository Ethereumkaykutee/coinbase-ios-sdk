/// `DepositResource` is a class which implements API methods for [Deposit Resource](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#deposits).
///
/// Deposit resource represents a deposit of funds using a payment method (e.g. a bank).
/// Each committed deposit also has an associated transaction.
///
/// - Important:
///     Deposits can be started with `commit: false` which is useful when displaying the confirmation for a deposit.
///     These deposits will never complete and receive an associated transaction unless they are committed separately.
