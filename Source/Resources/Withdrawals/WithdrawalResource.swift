/// `WithdrawalResource` is a class which implements API methods for [Withdrawal Resource](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#withdrawals).
///
/// Withdrawal resource represents a withdrawal of funds using a payment method (e.g. a bank).
/// Each committed withdrawal also has a associated transaction.
///
/// - Important:
///     Withdrawal can be started with `commit: false` which is useful when displaying the confirmation for a withdrawal.
///     These withdrawals will never complete and receive an associated transaction unless they are committed separately.
