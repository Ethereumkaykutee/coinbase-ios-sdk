/// `SellResource` is a class which implements API methods for [Sell Resource](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#sells).
///
/// Sell resource represents a sell of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin or ethereum using a payment
/// method (either a bank or a fiat account). Each committed sell also has an associated transaction.
///
/// - Important:
///     Sells can be started with `commit: false` which is useful when displaying the confirmation for a sell.
///     These sells will never complete and receive an associated transaction unless they are committed separately.
