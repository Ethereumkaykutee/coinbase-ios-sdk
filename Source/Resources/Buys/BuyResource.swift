/// `BuyResource` is a class which implements API methods for [Buy Resource](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#buys).
///
/// Buy resource represents a purchase of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin or ethereum using a payment
/// method (either a bank or a fiat account). Each committed buy also has an associated transaction.
///
/// - Important:
///     Buys can be started with `commit: false` which is useful when displaying the confirmation for a buy.
///     These buys will never complete and receive an associated transaction unless they are committed separately.
///
/// - Warning:
///     When using this endpoint, it is possible that coinbase system will not be able to process the buy as normal.
///     If this is the case, our system will return a `400` error with an `id` of `unknown_error`.
